#To Do List (Python)
You can add items, checked them off, display 
what items are there and which ones are checked, and exit the program.
Display main menu
ex. 
  1. add item to the list
  2. check off the item
  3. Display the list
  4. exit the program
  
Program will ask for input and run until the user decided to exit

1. add item to the list
   ask them for the name of the list
   add that string to the arraylist and assign false to the boolean by default

2. check off item
   let the user choose the number to check off
   if they choose the item that is already checked
      tell them it is already checked and ask them
      if they want to check off other item or they want to go back to the main menu
   else
      change the boolean value of the item
      tell them the item is checked off

3. Display to do list
show [X] if it is not done yet
show [V] if it is done
if there is nothing in the list, display "There is no task in the list."

ex. 
  1. [X] cook rice 
  2. [V] clean the kitchen
  3. [X] homework

4. Say Thank you for using the problem
   Say Have a great day!
 
   End the program
